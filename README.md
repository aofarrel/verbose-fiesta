# Verbose Fiesta 🥳
Scraps of documentation for various projects. This is mostly for my own organizational purposes. Nevertheless, if you feel it could be improved, criticism and contributions are welcome. **Please be aware that this page might not represent the most up-to-date version of documentation.**

The name of this repository was the random one suggested by GitHub, and since it was such a good description of my writing style, it stuck.

## Brief overview
Dockstore folder: Documentation related to [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/), a UCSC/OICR collaboration for bioinformatics workflows. 

Terra folder: Documentation related to [Terra](https:/terra.bio/), a Broad Institute platform for using bioinformatics workflows on a Google Cloud backend.
