# ORCIDs in Dockstore
Have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)? You can now connect it to your Dockstore account.

## Linking your ORCID to your Dockstore account
The process is quite simple. If you are logged in now, you can [click here](https://dockstore.org/accounts?tab=accounts) to get there, or just simply choose "Account" from the dropdown menu on the top right where your username is displayed. This will take you to a tab where you can control of your linked services, such as Github and Quay. One of those, towards the bottom of the list, is the newly added ability to link your account with ORCID.

From here, you'll be redirect to ORCID. With just a few clicks, you will now see this on the link services page of Dockstore.

Now that your account is linked, when someone views an organization page of which you are a member, your ORCID will show up, helping connect your work on Dockstore with all of your other scientific contributions.
