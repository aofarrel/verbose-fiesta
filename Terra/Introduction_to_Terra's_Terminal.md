# Introduction to Terra's Terminal
###### tags: `docs`

When using a workspace and scrolled to the top of the page, you may notice these icons on the top right corner of your webpage. They will lead you to one of the best-kept secrets of Terra - a command line interface.

Click on the icon to the left of the play or pause button, and you will be taken to a page that resembles a UNIX terminal. (You will need to start a notebook VM first if one is not already running.) From here, you can perform tasks like you would in a Jupyter notebook. Unlike a Jupyter notebook, tasks performed here are not reproducible or easily shared with other users, but this may be quicker depending on your specific needs.

## How to Move Files Between the Terminal and Your Workspace Bucket
Because Terra’s terminal shares a VM with Jupyter notebooks, any files within the VM are generated by calling commands in your Jupyter notebook or in the associated notebook terminal. Files in your workspace “Data” section are in a separate location (your workspace’s bucket). The notebook VM should not be considered for persistent storage, and any time you hit “delete runtime” you will lose all data you saved to that runtime VM. Additionally, workflows cannot call data that is within the notebook VM. Therefore, you should move files you want to use for downstream analyses, or keep for an extended period of time, from the VM to your workspace’s bucket. 

First of all, make sure you know the name of your workspace Google Bucket. The quickest way to find that is to go to your workspace dashboard and check the right-hand column. You will see a link under the heading "Google Bucket" that you can copy.

Open up Terra's terminal. Type in `ls` and hit enter to verify that your files are indeed in your current working directory.

Let's say the file in your terminal VM is called README.txt, and your workspace Google Bucket address is fc-your-bucket-name-here. You would use the following command to move that text file into your workspace Google Bucket:

`gsutil cp README.txt gs://fc-your-bucket-name-here/`

If you wish to create a psuedofolder with README.txt in it, simply attach the desired psuedofolder name to the gs URI of your bucket. If this psuedofolder already exists, this command will also place the file in the existing psuedofolder.

`gsutil cp README.txt gs://fc-your-bucket-name-here/psuedofolder/`

For more information on using `gsutil cp`, [see Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp).

## Miscellanous Notes

#### Copy-Pasting in Terra's terminal
You will not be able to use keyboard shortcuts to paste into Terra's terminal. Instead, right-click and select paste.

#### Terra's terminal stops responding
Terra's terminal will sometimes hiccup if you change browser tabs, due to the way that some browsers handle tab-switching and manage memory. It is best to avoid switching tabs away from the terminal window if it's currently doing something. If it does hang, refresh the page.
